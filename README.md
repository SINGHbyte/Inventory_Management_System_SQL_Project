📦 Inventory Management System – SQL Project
📌 Project Overview

This project implements an Inventory Management System using MySQL. It manages products, suppliers, stock, purchases, and sales through a well-structured relational database design. SQL queries are used to analyze inventory levels, sales performance, and reorder requirements, demonstrating core database concepts.

❓ Problem Statement

Manual inventory tracking often leads to inaccurate stock records, delayed reordering, and inefficient sales monitoring. This project addresses these challenges by using a centralized database system that ensures data consistency, accuracy, and efficient inventory management.

🎯 Project Objectives

To design a relational database for inventory management

To store and manage product, supplier, stock, purchase, and sales data

To perform meaningful data analysis using SQL queries

To identify low-stock items and analyze sales performance

To demonstrate the practical application of SQL concepts

🗄️ Database Design

The database is designed using multiple interrelated tables with primary keys and foreign keys to maintain data integrity and reduce redundancy.

Main Tables:

Products

Suppliers

Stock

Purchases

Sales

An ER Diagram is used to visually represent the relationships between these entities.

🧠 SQL Concepts Used

Data Definition Language (CREATE)

Data Manipulation Language (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

Primary Key and Foreign Key constraints

Joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN)

Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)

GROUP BY and HAVING clauses

Subqueries

📊 Key Analysis Performed

Inventory stock availability tracking

Low-stock and reorder level analysis

Sales performance analysis

Product-wise sales summary

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

MySQL

SQL
