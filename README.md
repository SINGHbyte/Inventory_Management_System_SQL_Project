# Inventory_Management_System_SQL_Project 
📌 Project Overview
This project implements an Inventory Management System using MySQL. It manages products, suppliers, stock, and sales through a relational database design. SQL queries are used to analyze inventory levels, sales performance, and reorder requirements, demonstrating core database concepts.

❓ Problem Statement
Manual inventory tracking often leads to inaccurate stock records, delayed reordering, and poor sales monitoring. This project aims to solve these issues by using a centralized database system that ensures data consistency and efficient inventory management.

🎯 Project Objectives
To design a relational database for inventory management
To store and manage product, supplier, stock, and sales data
To perform data analysis using SQL queries
To identify low-stock items and sales performance
To demonstrate practical usage of SQL concepts

🗄️ Database Design
The database is designed using multiple related tables with primary and foreign keys to maintain data integrity.

Main Tables:
Products

Suppliers

Stock

Sales

Purchases

An ER Diagram is used to represent relationships between these entities.

🧠 SQL Concepts Used
CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
Primary Key & Foreign Key constraints
Joins (INNER, LEFT)
Aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG)
Group By & Having
Subqueries

📊 Key Analysis Performed
Stock availability tracking
Low stock / reorder level analysis
Sales performance analysis
Product-wise sales summary

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
MySQL
SQL
VS Code
